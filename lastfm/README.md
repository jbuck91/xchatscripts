LastFM plugin for HexChat
=========================

Displays currently playing track from LastFM, top three tags for track/artist and whether the track is loved.

Usage:
------
- Edit the `username = 'KillaB-zilla'` line in lastfm.py to equal your username.
- Use  `/np`  in HexChat to send your now playing info to current channel.

Notes:
------
- This script uses python3 which breaks compatibility with regular XChat.
- If you want to output to stdout, comment out the import for xchat and uncomment the one for stdout.

Example output:
---------------
    * milk np: Sublime - Garden Grove (ska, reggae, punk)
